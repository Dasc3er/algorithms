# Algorithms

Initially based on ideas explosed in [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects), then expanded to others.
Comments may be Italian depending on time of implementation ;)

Includes the following algorithms divided by language:
- **Sorting** - Merge sort and bubble sort, in [Assembly 8086](./Assembly/Sorting) (2015)
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** - Find the shortest path through a graph using its edges, in [Java](./Java/Dijkstra.java) (2016)
- Implementation of a Steganography procedure to hide messages in images, in [Java](./Java/Steganography.java) (2016)
- Implementation of the **[Scalable Distributed Approximation of Internal Measures for Clustering Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01430)**, in [Python](./Python/approximated_silhouette.py) (2022)
- Optimized implementation of the **[Hopkins Statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_statistic)** using [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) (works with large datasets), in [Python](./Python/hopkins_statistic.py) (2022)

Moreover, the repository includes:
- Solutions for a series on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) computational problems, solved in December 2018. Problems with score 1.x are not included.
- Solutions to basic exercises in Assembly (2015), partially developed in collaboration with @Bressa98
