# Algorithms

Initially based on ideas explosed in [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects), then expanded to others.
Comments may be Italian depending on time of implementation ;)

## Assembly 8086

The Assembly exercises and algorithms in this repository were implemented in 2014-15 (Italian only), and include:
- **Basic operations** on numbers (multiplication, MCD/GCD, MCM/LCM, mean, max and min, divisibility check) and on arrays
- **Sorting** - Merge sort and bubble sort, in [Assembly 8086](./Assembly/Sorting)

Some of these solutions were developed in partially with [@Bressa98](https://github.com/Bressa98).

## Java

The Java section of this repository includes most relevant exercises and experiments done over the years (2015-17, Italian only) on the language.

Algorithms implemented: 
- Merge and Bubble sort algorithms
- Base64 string conversion and URL Encoding procedure
- Binary search
- Cesare's Cryptosystem 
- [**Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**](./Java/dijkstra/Dijkstra.java) (2016)
- [Steganography procedure](./Java/steganography/Steganography.java) to hide messages in images (2016)

Experiments included:
- Extendable Dama game* (with partial porting in Swing)
- Flappy game*
- Clickball game*
- Labyrinth generation and solution*
- Demo graphical client and server for chat system (in FX and Swing)

* = Using a custom graphical helpers to divide the screen in independent rectangles

Moreover, this repository includes a series of solutions for some [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) computational problems, solved in December 2018. Problems with score 1.x are not included.

## Python

The Python code in this repository is mainly related to more recent experiments on algorithms for ML (documented in English):
- Implementation of the **[Scalable Distributed Approximation of Internal Measures for Clustering Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01430)**, in [Python](./Python/approximated_silhouette.py) (2022)
- Optimized implementation of the **[Hopkins Statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_statistic)** using [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) (works with large datasets), in [Python](./Python/hopkins_statistic.py) (2022)

The repository includes also some exercises of the above sections in Python (Italian only):
- Cesare and Vigenere's cryptosystems
- Basic games
- Merge sort
- Experiment on Vigenere's cryptosystem in a client-server setup

## LogoIT

The repository contains some exercises on the LogoIT "language", which provides a [Turtle-like](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) experience for programming in the Italian language (2012-14 circa).
