# Algorithms

Initially based on ideas explosed in [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects), then expanded to others.
Comments may be Italian depending on time of implementation ;)

Includes:
- **Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort, in [Assembly 8086](./Assembly/Sorting)
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges, in [Java](./Java/Dijkstra.java)
